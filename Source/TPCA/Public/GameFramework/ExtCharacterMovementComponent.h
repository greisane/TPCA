 *     - Generic Action (any action that affects movement such as aiming, skeaning, etc...)
 *
 * Note that MaxAcceleration and GroundFriction are treated as temporaries and potentially overwriten every frame.
 * Users can set a desired max acceleration using the member corresponding to the specific movement mode of choice. ie. MaxFlyAcceleration.
 * WalkFriction can be used to set the desired friction for Walking. Other movement modes work with the friction defined by the physics volume.
 *
 * Note that walk can be active simultaneously to other actions such as jump, crouch, generic action and even sprint.
 *
 * Movement rotation can be interpolated. Turn in place can be delayed but can only emply a constant rotation rate. This is to
 * reduce the impact of network corrections.
 *
 * Also note that MaxWalkSpeedCrouched is not used so any assigned value will be ignored. Set up the appropriate movement setting
 * in the character class instead.
